    <h1>What is XML?</h1>
<ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible Markup Languague</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup languague</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML is designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
            <li>XML are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe the data</li>
    <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designs to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The main diference between XML and HTML</h2>
        <strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p>
    <p>XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</p>
    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus in what data is.</p>
    <p>HTML was designed to display data and focus how data looks.</p>
    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h2>XML does not DO anything</h2>
    <strong>XML was not designed to DO anything.</strong>
    <p></p>
<p>Maybe its a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to structure, store and send information.</p>
    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>
    <textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="10">
    <note>
    <to>Tove</to>
    <from>Jani</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
     </note>
</textarea>
            <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. But still, this XML document not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
